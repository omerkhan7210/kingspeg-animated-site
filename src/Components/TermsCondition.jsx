You must not attempt to gain unauthorised access to our site, the server on which our site is or may at any time be stored or any server, computer or database connected to our site. You must not attack our site via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of-service attack. By breaching this provision, you would commit a criminal offence under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. We will report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities and We will co-operate with those authorities by disclosing your identity to them. In the event of such a breach, your right to use our site will cease immediately.<br /><br /><br /><span className="subtitle-medium null dark">3. Confidentiality<br /></span><br />3.1 Each party shall keep the other party's Confidential Information strictly confidential and not use it otherwise than for the purposes of these terms and conditions, and shall return it on demand and not retain copies of it.<br /><br />3.2 Either party may disclose Confidential Information to its legal and other advisors for the purposes of obtaining advice from them.<br /><br />3.3 We will collect your data and keep your personal details confidential unless we get your permission to use them.<br /><br />3.4 This clause shall continue notwithstanding termination of these terms and conditions.<br /><br /><br /><span className="subtitle-medium null dark">4. Cookies policy</span><br /><br />4.1 As you interact with our Site, We will automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies and other similar technologies. We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of our Site.<br /><br />4.2 You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies or to alert you when Sites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this Site may become inaccessible or not function properly.<br /><br />4.3 We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site (the "interactive services"). Where We do provide any interactive service, We will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical). We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and We will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service We provide on our site, and We expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.<br /><br />The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.<br /><br />Where We do moderate an interactive service, We will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.<br />‍<br /><br /><span className="subtitle-medium null dark">5.
